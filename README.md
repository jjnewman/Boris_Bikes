# Boris Bikes

This was our walkthrough during the first week of Makers, pairing with a different person each day. The first part of the challenge was following a Makers tutorial, but then it was left to us to finish it off by adding the requisite tests and classes. The main challenges were:
- Learning to pair program. This was naturally frustrating at times initially, adapting to the different pace of the partner, but the benefits and enjoyment started filtering through after a couple of days.
- TDD was also a new concept at this stage and again it took a while for the benefits to become clear. I think this is a natural process as most of the rest of the cohort felt similarly.
- Using object "doubles" for testing was baffling at this stage - the concept took until the weekend challenge to really sink in!
